*Wow, this one was pretty tough! I've just finished my MSc and started to work
at my first job as a data scientist. And I thought that teaching
other is much simpler than being taught. That was the biggest mistake I've
ever made. Amount of work to prepare lectures and homework was really a challenge for me,
so I spent almost all weekends during spring 2018, preparing lecture notes and reviewing
homework.*

Here a couple of lessons I have learned from this course:
1. I have selected C# and .NET as the environment for course assignments, but my students
were barely able to comprehend it. I can agree, that they should learn it even if
it more complex than Python; but I also **already bored of it after 5 years of .NET development**.
I guess I will stand on Python for the next year assignments.
1. Lectures are really much more interactive when you mix them with ad hoc practical
assignments. On the lecture about aggregation, I have **prepared a Kaggle dataset and we
have a lot of fun** querying it for different data slices.
2. I prepared a functional test to check students solutions automatically, yet I **still needed
to clone their code and start the test manually**. This was a big overhead on these few actions.
I will use Travis or something like that to automate this process next year.
    * Also, I made the test available for students and they really overused it.
    Many of them **didn't even bother to test** their solutions manually.
