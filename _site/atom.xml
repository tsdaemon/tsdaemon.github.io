        <title>Neural Machine Translation With PyTorch</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently I did a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tsdaemon/dl-nlp-2018&quot;&gt;3-day workshop about Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt;.
Clearly 3 days was not enough to cover all topics in this broad field, therefore
I decided to create a series of practical tutorials about Neural Machine Translation
in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pytorch.org/&quot;&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;. In this series I will start with a simple neural
translation model and gradually improve it using
modern neural methods and techniques. In the first tutorial I will create
Ukrainian-German translator with an encoder-decoder model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
