My name is Anatolii. I am a science and education enthusiast. In this blog I
want to share my experience about deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural
language processing, data visualization and software development.

Currently I am a software developer and data science associate in
[DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/). Also I am doing computer science
lectures in Ukrainian Catholic University.
